Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique commonly used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in multivariate data. However, traditional PCA assumes that the variables are continuous and normally distributed. When dealing with ordinal data, where the variables have ordered categories but do not necessarily have a continuous distribution, some modifications are needed.

One approach for handling ordinal data in PCA is to use polychoric or polyserial correlations instead of the standard Pearson correlation. Polychoric correlation is suitable for ordinal variables with more than two categories, while polyserial correlation is appropriate when one of the variables is continuous. These correlations estimate the underlying latent (unobserved) continuous variables that give rise to the observed ordinal categories.
